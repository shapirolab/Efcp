To prepare an emulator:

1. gcc mkmk.c -o mkmk

   This produces an executable, mkmk, which can be used to create
   a makefile.

2. do-<target> [ <additional parameters> ]

   <target> is one of cygwin, linux, maci386, macosx, redhat, solaris, sgi,
            ubuntu .
   <additional parameters> may include: dbg dbgl opt o2 o4 .

   This calls mkmk (with <additional parameters>) to create a makefile for
   <target>.

3. make
